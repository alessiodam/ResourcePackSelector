# ResourcePackSelector

A way to let players choose between server-approved resource packs.
After starting the plugin for the first time, shutdown the server and add resource packs to the config file located in ResourcePackSelector/config.yml.

Example config:

```yml
resourcePacks:
  Default: https://mediafilez.forgecdn.net/files/4572/162/VanillaDefault+1.20.zip
  Custom1: https://yourdirectdownload.link/custompack1.zip
  Custom2: https://yourdirectdownload.link/custompack2.zip
```
